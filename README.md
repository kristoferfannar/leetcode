# leetcode

## Welcome!

Welcome to my collection of leetcode solutions!
If all goes well, this repository should be somewhat filled with all kinds of leetcode solutions, spanning multiple languages and with performance ranging from well below to slightly above average.

In each problem directory, you'll maybe find some information on my solutions (either as a separate text file, or as code comments above the solutions), depending on how diligent I am in my notetaking.

## Stats

As a side project, I'd also like to have an importable markdown banner showing some leetcode statistics, resembling anuraghzra's [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) project.

Nevermind... As with most not-bad ideas I get, its already been implemented.
